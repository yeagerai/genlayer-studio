## 👀 About

This Studio is an interactive sandbox designed for developers to explore the potential of the [GenLayer Protocol](https://genlayer.com/). It replicates the GenLayer network's execution environment and consensus algorithm, but offers a controlled and local environment to test different ideas and behaviors.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run the GenLayer environment. **Required version**: Docker 26+
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool. **Required version**: Node.js 18+

## 🛠️ Installation and usage

```
$ npm install -g genlayer
$ genlayer init
```

To run genlayer again just run:

```
$ genlayer up
```
After executing those commands a new tab will open in your browser with the GenLayer Studio. Additional installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.genlayer.com/simulator/installation)

### Enabling Hardhat Node
If you need to interact with a local Hardhat node for transaction processing, make sure to add the following to your `.env` file:

```
HARDHAT_URL=http://hardhat
HARDHAT_PORT=8545
COMPOSE_PROFILES=hardhat
```

This will enable the Hardhat service when running `genlayer up`.

### Disabling Hardhat Node
If you need to disable the Hardhat node, make sure to remove the following from your `.env` file:

```
HARDHAT_URL=
HARDHAT_PORT=
COMPOSE_PROFILES=
```

This will disable the Hardhat service when running `genlayer up`.

## 🚀 Key Features
* 🖥️ **Test Locally:** Developers can test Intelligent Contracts in a local environment, replicating the GenLayer network without the need for deployment. This speeds up the development cycle and reduces the risk of errors in the live environment.

* 🧪 **Versatile Scenario Testing:** The Studio allows developers to create and test contracts under various simulated network conditions. This includes stress testing under high transaction loads, simulating network delays, and testing different consensus outcomes.

* 🔄 **Changeable LLM Validators:** Developers can modify the large language models (LLMs) used by validators within the Studio. This allows for testing of security, efficiency, and accuracy by running different LLMs to validate transactions.


## 📖 The Docs
Detailed information of how to use the Studio can be found at [GenLayer Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/).
